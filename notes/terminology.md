- *likelihood* ***P(D|H)*** The probability of the data under hypothesis is called the likelihood.
- *normalizing* ***P(D)*** The probability of the data under any hypothesis.
- *posterior* ***P(H|D)*** What we want to compute, i.e. the probability of the hypothesis after we see the data.
- *prior* ***P(H)*** The probability of the hypothesis before we see the data, the prior probability.
- *probability mass function (pmf)* Mathematical reprsetation of a distribution. E.g. for a fair die a `pmf` would return `1/6` for the values [1,...,6]
- *suite* A set of hypotheses that are both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
