# Think Bayes Workspace

Resources, exercises, and experiments as I read through [Think Bayes][1].

## Referenced Code

Dependencies have been downloaded to `src/vendor/AllenDowney`, then can be found
online [here][2] and [here][3].

It's also noted that [matplotlib][4], [NumPy][5], and [SciPy][6] are used by
some programs in the book. Note: it may be easier to just install these packages
with [pip][7]:

```
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
```
